1.1   The Project

The project, Breakin' Logistics, seeks to improve Star Node Entertainment's inventory & auditing practices, in addition to personnel management processes, by implementing an automated web application presence for the purpose of tracking personnel while traveling and the shipment of equipment to scheduled venues; by analyzing the current state of Star Node Entertainments manual processes and daily routines—identifying and implementing critical improvements that encourages positive user interactions, and establishing policy and standards for application platform management, design, content, presentation and development--developing a modern, compelling user-friendly interface design and set of design templates.


1.2   Milestones

Several milestones have been established and will act as a set of goals and a tracking mechanism for achieving the goals. While the milestones are initially static, they can be dynamic if needed. The accompanying table lists important project milestones, with estimated dates of completion. The milestone schedule indicates out emphasis on planning for implementation.

1.3   Budget Analysis

The project budget analysis includes complete provisions for plan-vs-actual estimates--the project executive will hold monthly follow-up meetings to discuss variances and course corrections. Initially, Star Node Entertainment projected the planned development costs of the automated personnel and equipment tracking software at around $100,000.00—the budgeting management process was projected through a top-down approach by senior executives, which was then passed down to the next functional department, where additional, more specific information was collected. 

At the time, the top-down approach was chosen under the impression that the project was only going to extend for one year, however, after consulting with Shade Leaf Engineering & Consulting, the project was decided to under-go a full season of live user acceptance testing, with an estimated actual costs at around $150,000.00—once the project begins, the project will move into a bottom-up approach and be implemented into the budget management process. 

As the bottom-up approach is implemented, the project executive will begin sending up approval requests, for funds, that have not been fully depleted on specific expense types first, to be directed towards other expenses that may arise, such as, expenses towards project delays—the bottom-up approach, once implemented, will continue over the course of the project life cycle unless a mandatory funding limit is enforced. The accompanying table lists planned-vs-actual budgeting estimates for Breakin' Logistics project.
 

1.4   Business Need

Star Node Entertainment is currently relying on a manual process of auditing and tracking equipment and merchandise at their warehouses and scheduled venues, which is causing an annual loss in profits due to the mismanagement of valuable assets. Star Node Entertainment seeks to have developed a standardized automated mobile web-application, with modern visual designs, that will improve auditing processes and tracking methods for directors, supervisors, managers, employees, technicians and staff, establishing the ability to manage, service, and support scheduled venues more efficiently, improving communication between staff, with the ability to track all personnel with every scheduled venue; while giving the ease of personnel to project their travel statuses, and technicians to report equipment damages 
or losses—leading to a more efficient approach with overall increases in yearly revenue.
